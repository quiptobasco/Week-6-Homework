# Week-6-Homework - Weather Dashboard

## Description:
An application to search and display current weather and a five-day forecast.  When you search for a city, it will save it into local storage and add it to a search history.  You can then search for a new city in the search box or click one of the previously searched cities and get the weather for it.
